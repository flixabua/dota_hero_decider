# dota_hero_decider
For the dota player, that can't decide what to play, but is too afraid of the random button. Selects 1 or more random heroes from a list you decide on

## Roadmap / Abstract
This is just some small script made for me and my friends, that I will change and modify as I please.
So no real plan, structure or real life use

## Usage

### Configuration:
If you really want to use this script, add your own list of heroes to the HeroDecider.py file, and change the hero_list 
in the main loop. If not, you will simply get my prefered list.

You need python, though.

### Execution
call the python file "HeroDecider.py" and add a number as arguement if you want more than 1 result:

> python3 HeroDecider.py

> python3 HeroDecider.py 3
